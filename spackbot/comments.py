Are you interested in adopting any of these package(s)? If so, simply add the following to the package class:

_You don't have to be a Spack expert or package developer in order to be a "maintainer," it just gives us a list of users willing to review PRs or debug issues relating to this package. A package can have multiple maintainers; just add a list of GitHub handles of anyone who wants to volunteer._

I'm sorry, gitlab does not have your latest revision yet, I can't run that pipeline for you right now.

One likely possibility is that your PR pipeline has been temporarily [deferred](https://github.com/spack/spack-infrastructure/blob/main/docs/deferred_pipelines.md), in which case, it is awaiting a `develop` pipeline, and will be run when that finishes.

Please check the gitlab commit status message to see if more information is available.
