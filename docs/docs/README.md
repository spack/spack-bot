## Quick Start

Here are some quick commands to get you started, and you can check out more detailed [developer guide](developer-guide/developer-guide) or [user guide](user-guide/user-guide). There are several different was you might want to interact with me, and other ways I will interact with you!

### Say hello

Want to give me a friendly hello? I always love a quick wave, so if you want to say hello:

```bash
@spackbot hello!
```

### Help

Oh no! I've you've forgotten a command, hopefully you can remember how to ask me for help! There are two ways:

```bash
@spackbot help
@spackbot commands
```

### Pipelines

Spack runs an additional pipeline on GitLab CI. If you have write access to the repository (meaning you opened the PR or are a maintainer) you can ask me to re-run the GitLab pipeline for you!

```bash
@spackbot run pipeline
@spackbot re-run pipeline
```

## Interactions

I'm a hard working robot, so I'll also be helping on the following things without you needing to ask!

### Style

If your style checks fail (meaning import order, linting, etc.) I'll give you a heads up, and give you a command to run to fix them automatically. If you have write access you can then ask me to fix the style for you.

### Labels

Don't you love GitHub labels? I do! Whenever you open a pull request, I'll take a peek at what changes you've made and add the appropriate labels. I'm just trying to help the maintainers out!

### Maintainers

Are you opening a pull request for a package? I'll help to find and ping maintainers for it! And if there aren't any, I'll start a discussion to figure out who might be able to do it.

And I just might have some other commands and jokes up my sleeve! Want to learn more? Browse the links on the left navigation, or
<a href="https://github.com/spack/spackbot" target="_blank">ask me a question</a>. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜‰

### Packages

It's often easier (and faster!) to review pull requests when they are opened for single packages.
Toward this aim, if Spackbot sees that you've opened a pull request that is changing multiple packages,
he will suggest to open a different pull request for each package.
