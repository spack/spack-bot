This is a GitHub bot for the [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack)
project. It automates various workflow tasks and handles jobs like:

* Notifying maintainers about relevant pull requests;
* Adding maintainers as reviewers if they are in the
  [maintainers team](https://github.com/orgs/spack/teams/maintainers) in the
  [Spack organization](https://github.com/spack);
* Inviting new maintainers to the maintainers team; and
* Automatically labeling pull requests based on modified files.

This list could easily expand in the future.

This app was built using [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) and
[gidgethub](https://github.com/brettcannon/gidgethub), based on @Mariatta's
excellent
[GitHub Bot Tutorial](https://github-bot-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
